# java_DungeonGame
Dungeon game implemented in Java.

This exercise is part of the online "Object-Oriented programming with Java" course from the University of Helsinki.
From the course page:

"The user can move by giving a sequence of commands and pressing Enter. The commands are:

    w go up
    s go down
    a go left
    d go right

When the user commands are executed (the user can give many commands at once), a new game situation is drawn. If the lamp charge reaches 0, the game ends and the text YOU LOSE is printed on the board.

The vampires move randomly in the game, and they take one step for each step the player takes. If the player and a vampire run into each other (even momentarily) the vampire is destroyed. If a vampire tries to step outside the board, or into a place already occupied by another vampire, the move is not executed. When all the vampires are destroyed, the game ends and it prints YOU WIN."
